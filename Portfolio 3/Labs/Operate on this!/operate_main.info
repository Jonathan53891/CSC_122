	- Name: Jonathan Pilafas
	- Class for which program was written: CSC122-001
	- Program: Lab - Operate on this!
	- Project Name: operate_main
	- Project Type: .cpp
	- Levels Attempted:
		- Given assignment is Level 2.
		- This program also has an overload operator [] that can return
		  the x or y part of the point (Level 1).
		- So this assignment is Level 2 + Level 1 = Level 3
    
	- Program Description:
 	 
  	This C++ program includes overloaded operators for a point class that
	allows for easy inputting/outputting, equality checks, can return the 
	distance between 2 points, and can find the midpoint between 2 points.
