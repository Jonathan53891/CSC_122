    - Program Description:
      
      This C++ program calculates basic statistics for a set of numbers 
      stored in a file. The user inputs the name of the file that they are
      using, whhere the program was constructed to withstand various file 
      opening errors.
      
      The data in the file will be a space-separated list of numbers. It must
      be noted that the program acts without knowing the length of the list 
      ahead of time. The program then outputs the amount of numbers inside
      the list, the list's minimum and maximum values, and calculates the
      list's overall average as well as its standard deviation.
