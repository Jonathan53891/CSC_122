    - Project Name: louie_main
    - Project Type: .cpp
    - Levels Attempted:
        - Given assignment is Level 2
    - No greater levels attempted
    - So this assignment is Level 2 + Level 0 = Level 2
    
    - Program Description:
      
      This C++ program creates a table based on the user's choice of basic
      mathematical operations:
        - addition
        - subraction
        - multiplication
        - division
        - remainders
      
      These operations are performed using only integers.
      
      This program alos allows the user to choose the size of the table. 
      For instance, the choice '4' will create a 4x4 table, the choice 
      '12' will create a 12x12 table, and so on. This program limits the 
      size of this table to 20 columns for formatting purposes.
      
      In addition, this program was also constructed to ultimately produce
      a neat and organized output for the user to comprehend and understand
      with no trouble whatsoever.
