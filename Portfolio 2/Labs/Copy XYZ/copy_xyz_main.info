    - Class for which program was written: CSC122-001
    - Program: Lab - "Copy XYZ"
    - Project Name: copy_xyz_main
    - Project Type: .cpp
    - Levels Attempted:
        - Given assignment is Level 1
    - Program allows user to place blank lines between their data groups, 
    which is Level 1.
    - Program allows the user to place whole-line comments in their data file,
    which is Level 1.5.
    - Program allows for end-of-line comments, which is Level 1
    - So this assignment is Level 1 + Level 1 + Level 1.5 + Level 1 = Level 4.5
    
    - Program Description:
      
      This C++ program is a data transfer of one file to another file. This
      means it will ignore comments and spaces, but it successfully transfers
      the name of the student, their ID, their GPA, and their letter grade. The
      user can type from te keyboard to choose which file they would like to 
      make the copy file and which file they would like to make the output file.
      The program automatically checks that there is not already an existing
      file of the same name that the output would overwrite.
