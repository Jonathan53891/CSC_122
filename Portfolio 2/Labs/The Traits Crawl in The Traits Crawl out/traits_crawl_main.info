      This C++ program takes in a file with an Experiment name, population
      number, creature name, name of trait 1, name of trait 2, amount of 
      creatures with trait 1, and amount of creatures with trait 2. From there,
      the program will automatically output a nicely formatted file that 
      calculates the percentage of creatures that contain trait 1, as well as
      the creatures that contain trait 2.
