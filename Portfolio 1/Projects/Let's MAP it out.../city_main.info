    - Program: Project - "Map it Out"
    - Project Type: .cpp
    - Levels Attempted: 
    	- Given assignment is Level 4.
	- Program also adds a third class to manage the city list to keep the 
	main uncluttered by list management details, which is Level 2.
	- So this assignment is Level 4 + Level 2 = Level 6.
    
    - Program Description: 
      
      This program allows the user to enter a city's information (name and 
      coordinates). The program can calculate the distance between two cities 
      that the user decides on. The program can also print a list of all the 
      cities. If the list is full, the user is able to override a city or 
      cancel. The program's automatic default consists of the following:
      	- If the list has exactly two cities, it will calculate the distance 
	between two.
	- If the list has less than two cities, the program will display an 
	error that notifies the user there are not enough cities to calculate 
	the distance. 
	- If the list has more than two cities, the user will choose which 
	two cites he or she wants to find the distance of.
