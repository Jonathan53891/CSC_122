    - Program Description: 
      
      This C++ program is a function that allows a case-insensitive comparison 
      of two strings. This is done without altering the strings at all 
      throughout the duration of the program. In addition, this program does 
      not make any copies of the string that is inputted, rather the program 
      passes the strings by reference to maximize effectiveness/efficiency.
