    - Levels Attempted: 
    	- Given assignment is Level 2
	- Program also protects inputs from user stupidity, which is Level 1.
	- No greater levels attempted
	- So this assignment is Level 2 + Level 1 = Level 3
    
    - Program Description: 
      
      This C++ program is a function that allows a case-insensitive comparison 
      of two strings. This is done without altering the strings at all 
      throughout the duration of the program. In addition, this program does 
      not make any copies of the string that is inputted, rather the program 
      passes the strings by reference to maximize effectiveness/efficiency.
      
      This program takes in user input and verifies its validity depending on 
      specified return type. The types of data it works with are int, double 
      and char. If it is not valid, it will prompt the user to re-enter the 
      data. For numbers, the user can specify a valid range. In addition, it 
      can verify to see if inputted data is found in a list and if not, prompt 
      to re-enter in data.
